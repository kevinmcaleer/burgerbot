# BurgerBot
BurgerBot is the Raspberry Pi Pico powered round robot. 

This bite-sized robot uses the [Pimoroni Motor SHIM for Pico](https://www.pimoroni.com/motorshim) along with two Micro Metal Motors (N20 motors) with the JST connector attached. This makes connecting the Pico to the motors a piece of cake, or burger. 

BurgerBot also has a Range finder for detecting and avoiding objects (code comming soon).
